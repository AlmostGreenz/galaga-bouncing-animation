# galaga-bouncing-animation

A looping animation I made in 2017 that was inspired by Galaga.

It was made with JazzNESs' Galaga theme played overtop, but I have replaced it with the original Galaga them in order to post it here.

If you own the JazzNESs album, feel free to swap it out to see how the program was intended to be.
